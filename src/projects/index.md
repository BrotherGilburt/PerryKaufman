# Projects

Below are some of the projects I have worked on!

Project | Description
---|---
[This Website!](https://github.com/BrotherGilburt/PerryKaufman) | I created my website using a static site generator called Vuepress! Each page is made up of Vue components from the custom theme I created with content inserted from markdown files.
[Guild Wars 2 Achievement Point Calculator](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/v5kaps0c/) | Uses the accout data from the Guild Wars 2 API to calculate the total achievement points earned by the account
[Messenger UI](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/gjy2jdfk/) | A messenger UI with a very simple "chatbot" for demonstration purposes. The chatbot could easily be substituted with code receiving/sending responses to a server.
[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/kyzwm637/) | A two player Tic-Tac-Toe game using the HTML5 drag/drop API, and a custom event mixin.
