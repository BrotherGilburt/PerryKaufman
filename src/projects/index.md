# Projects

Below are some of the projects I have worked on!

Project | Description
---|---
**[This Website!](https://github.com/BrotherGilburt/PerryKaufman)** | I created my website using a static site generator called Vuepress! Each page is made up of Vue components from the custom theme I created.
**[Clean Slate Theme](https://github.com/BrotherGilburt/cleanslate)** | A responsive Wordpress theme created for the Clean Slate program of YWCA McLean County. Supports the WooCommerce plugin to allow for ecommerce. 
**[Drag and Drop List](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/5ocmvktr/)** | A list application that allows items to be added, removed, and reordered. If the list is long enough to create a scroll bar, the page can be pulled by dragging an item to the top or bottom of the page.
**[Guild Wars 2 Achievement Point Calculator](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/v5kaps0c/)** | Uses account data from the Guild Wars 2 API to calculate the total achievement points earned by an account.
**[Chat UI](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/gjy2jdfk/)** | A simple chat application with a "chatbot" that repeats whatever the user says. The chatbot could easily be substituted with code receiving/sending responses to a server.
**[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/kyzwm637/)** | A two player Tic-Tac-Toe game using the HTML5 drag/drop API, and a custom event mixin.
**[GW2Profile](https://github.com/BrotherGilburt/GW2Profile)** | An application that allows a user to create a profile showcasing their Guild Wars 2 account. This was a project I completed to learn how to create a Single Page App with Vue.js
**[Melting Pot](https://github.com/andrewjamen/MeltingPot)** | A social networking website made for a group project at Illinois State. I designed and coded the messaging system and and user status system with Java (Java Server Faces) and JavaScript. I have learned a lot since working on this project and it contains code that I would do differently today.
