# Projects

Below are some of the projects I have worked on!

Project | Description
---|---
[This Website!](https://github.com/BrotherGilburt/PerryKaufman) | I created my website using a static site generator called Vuepress! Each page is made up of Vue components from the custom theme I created.
[Drag and Drop List](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/5ocmvktr/) | A list application that allows items to be added, removed, and reordered. If the list is long enough to create a scroll bar, the page can be pulled by dragging an item to the top or bottom of the page.
[Guild Wars 2 Achievement Point Calculator](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/v5kaps0c/) | Uses account data from the Guild Wars 2 API to calculate the total achievement points earned by an account.
[Chat UI](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/gjy2jdfk/) | A simple chat application with a "chatbot" that repeats whatever the user says. The chatbot could easily be substituted with code receiving/sending responses to a server.
[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://jsfiddle.net/pdkaufm/kyzwm637/) | A two player Tic-Tac-Toe game using the HTML5 drag/drop API, and a custom event mixin.
