# Welcome!

My name is **Perry Kaufman** and I created this website to showcase some of my projects and to help organize reference material for languages and technologies I am learning. I made this website using a custom theme for [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/): a static site generator powered by Vue.

## About Me

I graduated from Illinois State University in the Summer of 2018 and am currently seeking full time employment. I am primarily interested in front-end developement with JavaScript, however I am also considering other developement roles using other languages such as Java and C#.

### Hobbies and Interests

I enjoy reading both fiction and nonfiction, however I prefer to listen to audiobooks and podcasts as I can listen while busy with work or chores. My favorite genre of fiction is science fiction, particuarly by authors who strive for scientific accuracy in their work. For nonfiction, I enjoy books, podcasts, and articles about history, current events, poliics, and science.

I also like to stay active and enjoy running, hiking, and seeing new places.

### Projects and Experience
Samples of my work can be found on the [Projects](/projects/) page. Most of my programming experience at Illinois State and Heartland was with Java, however I have also completed assignments with C, C++, PHP, and JavaScript. Java was used in most of the core computer science courses and web developement courses I took at ISU. I have also spent a lot of time outside class focusing on gaining experience with front-end web developement, particuarly with JavaScript, which is my favorite programming language.
