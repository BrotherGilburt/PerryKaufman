# Welcome

My name is **Perry Kaufman** and I created this website to showcase my resume and projects, as well as to organize reference material for languages and technologies I am learning. I made this website using a custom theme for [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/): a static site generator powered by Vue.
